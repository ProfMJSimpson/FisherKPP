Time-dependent PDE code for McCue, Bradshaw-Hajek and Simpson (2022) Exact time-dependent solutions of a Fisher-KPP-like equation obtained with nonclassical symmetry analysis. 
The code involves a straightforward method of lines approach to solve the nonlinear diffusion reaction PDE where space is discretised on a uniform mesh, and the resulting 
system of coupled ODEs is integrated using standard MATLAB libraries.  The code replicates data in Figure 1b of the preprint.  Later on I will post the link 
to the preprint here.
